# Monke Labs App

This is an assignment project given by monke labs with the following [figma design](<https://www.figma.com/file/SQMA05SjZwqHb88PQRLALV/Frontend-task-(Fit-grocer)?node-id=1%3A92&mode=dev>)

I used the following stack to attempt the task:

- Vite + React + Typescript
- ChakraUI for the UI

The reason I used the above stack

- Typescript; because it's addictive and it's hard to go back to javascript after using typescript
- Vite; because it's fast and makes it very easy to start a react project with typescript
- ChakraUI; I was deciding between tailwind and chakra, but I went with chakra because this is the UI library I used in the last company I was working with, I was already very comfortable using it's theming structure and built in UI components
